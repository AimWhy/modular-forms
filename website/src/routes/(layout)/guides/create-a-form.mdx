<Description>
  To create a form, use the createForm primitive in Solid and the useForm hook
  in Qwik. Both functions inizialize and return the state of the form.

# Create a form

<Solid block>

Like SolidJS, the library consists of primitives and components. To create a form you use the primitive <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A>.

If you use TypeScript, you can additionally define the fields and their values and pass the type as a generic. You also have the option to pass initial values to the form. See the <A href="/api/createForm">API reference</A> for more details.

> It is recommended to use `type` instead of `interface` as this currently requires an explicit index signature in TypeScript. More about this <a href={`${import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_URL}/issues/2#issuecomment-1321178563`} target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

```tsx
import { createForm } from '@modular-forms/solid';

type LoginForm = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

export default function App() {
  const loginForm = createForm<LoginForm>();
}
```

Using the return value of the <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A> primitive, you can directly access the reactive state to, for example, display a loading animation while the form is being submitted. In our <A href="/playground">playground</A>, you can use the debugger to track the state of the form as you make changes to it.

For the JSX part of your form, the library provides the <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A> component. If you prefer, you can also keep the HTML `<form />` element. The component is not mandatory, it just helps you write less code.

```tsx
import { createForm, Form } from '@modular-forms/solid';

type LoginForm = { … };

export default function App() {
  const loginForm = createForm<LoginForm>();

  return <Form of={loginForm}>…</Form>;
}
```

</Solid>

<Qwik block>

In Qwik, a form starts with its initial values returned via `routeLoader$`. With this information we can initialize the store of your form and enable Qwik to reliably start rendering your website on the server. We also use the initial values later to check if the value of a field has changed.

> It is recommended to use `type` instead of `interface` to define your form, as this currently requires an explicit index signature. More about this <a href={`${import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_URL}/issues/2#issuecomment-1321178563`} target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

```tsx
import { routeLoader$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type FormLoader } from '@modular-forms/qwik';

type LoginForm = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

export const useFormLoader = routeLoader$<FormLoader<LoginForm>>(() => ({
  email: '',
  password: '',
}));
```

This is followed by the <A href="/api/useForm">`useForm`</A> hook, to which you then pass your loader. The hook returns a tuple containing the store of the form in the first place and an object with the <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A>, <A href="/api/Field">`Field`</A> and <A href="/api/FieldArray">`FieldArray`</A> component afterwards. You can use the store to access the state of the form and make changes to it using methods that will be introduced later.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type FormLoader, useForm } from '@modular-forms/qwik';

type LoginForm = { … };

export const useFormLoader = routeLoader$<FormLoader<LoginForm>>(…);

export default component$(() => {
  const [loginForm, { Form, Field, FieldArray }] = useForm<LoginForm>({
    loader: useFormLoader(),
  });
}
```

You do not have to destructure the object with the components, as you can see in the next code example. In this way, the tuple allows you to freely name the two return values. This can be useful, for example, when a page contains multiple forms.

The returned <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A>, <A href="/api/Field">`Field`</A> and <A href="/api/FieldArray">`FieldArray`</A> component are already connected with the store of your form. Also, if you are using TypeScript, they are aware of your fields and their data types, which gives you the benefit of type safety and autocompletion.

In the JSX part of your component you start with the <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A> component. It encloses the fields of your form and through its properties you can define what happens when the form is submitted. More on this later.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type FormLoader, useForm } from '@modular-forms/qwik';

type LoginForm = { … };

export const useFormLoader = routeLoader$<FormLoader<LoginForm>>(…);

export default component$(() => {
  const [loginForm, Login] = useForm<LoginForm>({
    loader: useFormLoader(),
  });

  return <Login.Form>…</Login.Form>;
}
```

</Qwik>
