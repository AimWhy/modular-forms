# Handle submission

Now your first form is almost ready. There is only one little thing missing and that is the data processing when the form is submitted.

To make your form work even if JavaScript is disabled in your user's browser, we recommend using actions. Optionally, you can also perform the data processing on the client with <Solid>`onSubmit`</Solid><Qwik>`onSubmit$`</Qwik> or use both in parallel.

```tsx
import { createForm, SubmitHandler } from '@modular-forms/solid';
import { createRouteAction } from 'solid-start';
import { createServerAction$ } from 'solid-start/server';

type LoginForm = { … };

export default function App() {
  const [serverAction, runServerAction] = createServerAction$(
    async (formData: FormData) => {
      // Runs on server
    }
  );

  const [routeAction, runRouteAction] = createRouteAction(
    async (formData: FormData) => {
      // Runs on client or server
    }
  );

  const [loginForm, { Form, Field }] = createForm<LoginForm>({
    action: serverAction, // or "routeAction"
  });

  const handleSubmit: SubmitHandler<LoginForm> = (values, event) => {
    // Runs on client
  };

  return (
    <Form
      action={runServerAction} // or "runRouteAction"
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    >
      …
    </Form>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { $, component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type InitialValues, formAction$, zodForm$ } from '@modular-forms/qwik';

const loginSchema = z.object({ … });

type LoginForm = z.input<typeof loginSchema>;

export const useFormLoader = routeLoader$<InitialValues<LoginForm>>(…);

export const useFormAction = formAction$<LoginForm>((values) => {
  // Runs on server
}, zodForm$(loginSchema));

export default component$(() => {
  const [loginForm, { Form, Field }] = useForm<LoginForm>({
    loader: useFormLoader(),
    action: useFormAction(),
    validate: zodForm$(loginSchema),
  });

  const handleSubmit: SubmitHandler<LoginForm> = $((values, event) => {
    // Runs on client
  });

  return (
    <Form onSubmit$={handleSubmit}>
      …
    </Form>
  );
});
```

When the form is submitted, `event.preventDefault()` is executed by default to prevent the window from reloading so that the values can also be processed directly in the browser and the state of the form is preserved.

While the form is being submitted, you can use `loginForm.submitting` to display a loading animation and disable the submit button. Furthermore, using the `shouldDirty` property of the <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A> component, you have the option to have the form return only modified values. This reduces network traffic, for example if you only want to update values that have changed in your database.

## Throw and display errors

You can access errors thrown by your code in `onSubmit$` via `loginForm.response` to display them in your UI. For server-side code, we are a bit more cautious, as secret information might be preserved here, and therefore only output a generic error message. Therefore, for a better user experience, you should intentionally return erros if any occur.

```ts
export const useFormAction = formAction$<LoginForm>((values) => {
  if (error) {
    return {
      status: 'error',
      message: 'An error has occurred.',
    };
  }
});
```

You also have the option to add an error message to individual fields. This can be important if you want to do special validations manually in `formAction$`.

```ts
export const useFormAction = formAction$<LoginForm>((values) => {
  if (error) {
    return {
      errors: {
        email: 'This email has been blacklisted.',
      },
    };
  }
});
```
