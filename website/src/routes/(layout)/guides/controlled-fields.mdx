# Controlled fields

By default, all form fields are uncontrolled because that's the default behavior of the browser. For a simple login or contact form this is also quite sufficient.

However, as soon as your forms become more complex, for example you set initial values or change the values of a form field via <A href="/api/setValue">`setValue`</A>, it becomes necessary that you control your fields yourself. For example, depending on which HTML form field you use, you may need to set the `value`, `checked`, or `selected` attributes.

For a text input field you simply add the `value` attribute and pass the value of the field or in case of `undefined` or `null` an empty string.

```tsx
<Field of={contactForm} name="firstName">
  {(field) => (
    <input
      {...field.props}
      type="text"
      // Pass value or empty string
      value={field.value || ''}
    />
  )}
</Field>
```

> The HTML `<input type="file" />` element is an exception because it cannot be controlled. However, you have the possibility to control the UI around it. For inspiration you can use the code of our <a href="https://github.com/fabian-hiller/modular-forms/blob/main/packages/website/src/components/FileInput.tsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">`FileInput`</a> component from our <A href="/playground/special">playground</A>.
