# Nested fields

To add a little more structure to a complex form or to match the values of the form to your database, you can also nest your form fields in objects as deep as you like.

For example, in the example below, the first and last name are grouped under the object with the key `name`.

```ts
type ContactForm = {
  name: {
    first: string;
    last: string;
  };
  email: string;
  message: string;
};
```

When creating a nested field, use dot notation for the name to refer to the field. If you're using TypeScript, your editor should be able to autocomplete the name for you.

<Solid block>

```tsx
<Field of={contactForm} name="name.first">
  {(field) => <input {...field.props} type="text" />}
</Field>
```

</Solid>

<Qwik block>

```tsx
<Field name="name.first">
  {(field, props) => <input {...props} type="text" />}
</Field>
```

</Qwik>
