# Nested fields

To add a little more structure to a complex form or to match the values of the form to your database, you can also nest your form fields in objects as deep as you like.

## Type definition

For example, in the example below, the first and last name are grouped under the object with the key `name`.

```ts
type ContactForm = {
  name: {
    first: string;
    last: string;
  };
  email: string;
  message: string;
};
```

## Dot notation

When creating a nested field, use dot notation for the name to refer to the field. If you're using TypeScript, your editor should be able to autocomplete the name for you.

```tsx
<Field name="name.first">
  {(field, props) => <input {...props} type="text" />}
</Field>
```
