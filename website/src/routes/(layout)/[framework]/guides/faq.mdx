## Does it work with SolidStart?

Yes, Modular Forms works with <a href="https://start.solidjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SolidStart</a>. This website is proof of that! Currently, we are also working on integrating SolidStart's actions so that forms can be submitted and validated even when JavaScript is disabled or not sent to the browser. This is expected to be implemented in the next few weeks.

> Currently, it seems that the implementation is more difficult than expected. You can find the latest information <a href={`${import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_URL}/issues/3`} target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> on GitHub.

## Does the bundle size really start at 3 KB?

Yes, this information should be about right. The <A href="/playground">playground</A> on this website uses almost the entire functionality of Modular Forms through the various examples, coming to a bundle size of 4.7 KB. However, the size also depends on how much your bundler divides the library into small chunks.
