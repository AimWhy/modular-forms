# FAQ

Below you will find an overview of frequently asked questions. Please fill out an <a href="https://github.com/fabian-hiller/modular-forms/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">issue</a> to ask us anything. We're looking forward to your message.

## Does it work with SolidStart?

Yes, Modular Forms works with <a href="https://start.solidjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SolidStart</a>. This website is proof of that! Currently, we are also working on integrating SolidStart's actions so that forms can be submitted and validated even when JavaScript is disabled or not sent to the browser. This is expected to be implemented in the next few weeks.

> Currently, it seems that the implementation is more difficult than expected. You can find the latest information <a href="https://github.com/fabian-hiller/modular-forms/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> on GitHub.

## Does the bundle size really start at 2.5 KB?

Yes, this information should be about right. The <A href="/playground">playground</A> on this website uses almost the entire functionality of Modular Forms through the various examples, coming to a bundle size of 4.7 KB. However, the size also depends on how much your bundler divides the library into small chunks.

## Can we remove the `of` prop from the <A href="/api/Field">`Field`</A> component?

Technically it is possible, e.g. with the context API, to remove the `of` property from the <A href="/api/Field">`Field`</A> component. However, this would have the disadvantage that the type safety is lost and also the auto-completion in the editor no longer works, since this information comes from the return value of the <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A> primitive.

As the name implies, this is a modular library, which means that only the code you use ends up in your bundle. This reduces the bundle size to a minimum and provides better performance since the browser has to process less JavaScript. Of course, this has not only advantages. One tradeoff of this is that we have to pass the return value of <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A> to the other primitives, components, and methods, since it contains the state and type information. I think it is worth it and in my eyes it improves the readability of the code.
