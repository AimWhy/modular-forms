# Create a form

Like Solid, the library consists of primitives and components. To create a form you use the primitive <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A>.

If you use TypeScript, you can additionally define the fields and their values and pass the type as a generic. You also have the option to pass initial values to the form. See the <A href="/api/createForm">API reference</A> for more details.

```tsx
import { createForm } from '@modular-forms/solid';

type LoginForm = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

export default function App() {
  // Create login form
  const loginForm = createForm<LoginForm>();

  return …;
}
```

Using the return value of the <A href="/api/createForm">`createForm`</A> primitive, you can directly access the reactive state to, for example, display a loading animation while the form is being submitted. In our <A href="/playground">playground</A>, you can use the debugger to track the state of the form as you make changes to it.

For the JSX part of your form, the library provides the <A href="/api/Form">`Form`</A> component. If you prefer, you can also keep the HTML `<form />` element. The component is not mandatory, it just helps you write less code.

```tsx
import { createForm, Form } from '@modular-forms/solid';
import { loginUser } from '../api';

type LoginForm = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

export default function App() {
  const loginForm = createForm<LoginForm>();

  return (
    <Form of={loginForm} onSubmit={loginUser}>
      …
    </Form>
  );
}
```
