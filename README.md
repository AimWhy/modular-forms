# Modular Forms

Modular Forms is a JavaScript library that is build on top of [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) to validate and handle various types of forms. It is type-safe, fast by default and the bundle size is small due to a modular design. Try it out on our [website](https://modularforms.dev/playground)!

## 🧪 Features

- Small bundle size starting at 2.5 KB
- It's fast – DOM updates are fine-grained
- Type safety with autocompletion in editor
- Validate everything from emails to files
- Readable API that is similar to SolidJS
- Modular design – only use what you need
- No dependencies – except for SolidJS
- It's headless – you define the visual
- Supports all native HTML form fields

## 💥 Motivation

Since you're using SolidJS, I assume native performance, granular reactivity, and a small bundle size is important to you. Why should that not also count for your form library? Is there really a need to opt-in to a big and slow form library to meet all your needs?

I said no, and undertook an attempt to develop a modular form library that is as powerful as big libraries like Formik, React Hook Form and Felte, that is fast by default and takes only 2.5 KB (minified + gzipped) for a small and uncomplicated login form or up to 5 KB (minified + gzipped) for a complex and dynamic form. The result of this journey is this library called **Modular Forms**!

## 🙌🏼 Credits

When creating Modular Forms, I took inspiration from [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) and [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik). I also want to thank [Ryan Carniato](https://github.com/ryansolid) for his inspiring streams with exclusive and deep insights into different technologies and [David Di Biase](https://github.com/davedbase) for his help via Discord.
